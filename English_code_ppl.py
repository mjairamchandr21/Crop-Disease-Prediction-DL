    The primary goal of your crop disease prediction and prevention system is to provide farmers with an AI-powered platform that can forecast potential disease outbreaks and suggest appropriate preventive measures and treatments. This system leverages real-time data such as crop images, environmental factors (temperature, humidity, soil moisture), and historical disease patterns to deliver actionable insights that can help farmers protect their crops and improve yields.

    ### How It Helps Farmers

    1. **Early Detection of Disease:**
    - The system can identify early signs of diseases through image analysis and detect patterns of symptoms before they become visually obvious to farmers. Early intervention allows farmers to address the issue before it spreads and causes significant damage.
    
    2. **Data-Driven Decision Making:**
    - By analyzing environmental conditions like temperature, humidity, and rainfall in conjunction with the type of crops, the system can predict when certain diseases are more likely to occur. This allows farmers to make informed decisions about treatments, irrigation, and even planting times.

    3. **Minimization of Crop Losses:**
    - Early warnings about potential disease outbreaks enable farmers to take preventive actions, reducing crop losses. Disease-related crop damage is one of the major threats to food production, and timely interventions can save significant portions of a harvest.

    4. **Cost Savings:**
    - The system can recommend targeted treatments, like specific pesticides or organic solutions, only when necessary. This can prevent overuse of chemicals and fertilizers, saving farmers money and reducing environmental damage.
    
    5. **Increased Yields:**
    - By preventing disease and managing crops more effectively, farmers are more likely to achieve higher yields. This increases profitability and can contribute to food security on a larger scale.

    6. **Sustainability:**
    - The system encourages sustainable farming practices by optimizing the use of resources and minimizing unnecessary chemical applications. By using AI, the system can suggest the most environmentally friendly options available.


    By integrating AI-driven analysis with real-time data, farmers will have an innovative way to safeguard their crops and optimize their farming practices, making agriculture more productive and sustainable.

    Potato Early Blight is a common fungal disease caused by Alternaria solani. It typically affects potato plants during warm, humid weather and can lead to reduced yield and quality if not managed effectively.

    ### Symptoms:

    1.Leaf Spots: Dark brown to black spots with concentric rings (target-like appearance) develop on older leaves. These spots may enlarge, leading to significant leaf damage.

    2.Yellowing: Leaves surrounding the lesions may turn yellow and eventually die off.

    3.Stem Lesions: Dark, elongated lesions may appear on stems.

    4.Tuber Infection: In severe cases, tubers can show sunken, dark lesions that may have a leathery texture.


    ### Prevention:

    1. Crop Rotation: Rotate crops with non-host plants (such as legumes) to break the disease cycle.


    2. Resistant Varieties: Use potato varieties that are resistant to early blight.


    3. Good Field Hygiene: Remove and destroy infected plant debris after harvest to reduce the presence of the fungus.


    4. Proper Spacing and Pruning: Ensure adequate plant spacing and prune to allow better air circulation and reduce humidity around the plants.


    5. Water Management: Avoid overhead watering, as wet foliage promotes fungal growth. Water early in the day to allow leaves to dry quickly.


    6. Balanced Fertilization: Use balanced fertilization, ensuring adequate levels of potassium, which can help strengthen plant resistance.



    ### Cure:

    1. Fungicide Application:

    Chlorothalonil (e.g., Bravo)

    Mancozeb (e.g., Dithane)

    Azoxystrobin or Difenoconazole for systemic protection



    2. Application Timing: Begin fungicide application at the first sign of disease or as a preventive measure during conditions conducive to early blight (warm, wet weather).


    3. Copper-based Sprays: For organic control, copper-based fungicides can help manage early blight when used regularly.


    4. Integrated Management: Combine fungicide treatments with good cultural practices for best results.



    ### Key Points:

    1.Early Detection: Regularly inspect crops for early signs of infection and treat promptly.

    2.Integrated Management Approach: Use a combination of resistant varieties, good cultural practices, and fungicide applications to effectively control early blight.


    By implementing these practices, potato crops can be protected from early blight, ensuring healthier plants and better yields.""")

    Potato Late Blight is a devastating disease caused by the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora infestans. It is notorious for causing the Irish Potato Famine and continues to be a major threat to potato production, especially in areas with cool, wet weather.

    ### Symptoms:

    1.Leaf Lesions: Water-soaked, pale green to dark brown or black lesions appear on leaves, often starting at the edges. Lesions may expand rapidly and become necrotic.

    2.White Fungal Growth: A white, fuzzy mold often develops on the undersides of infected leaves in humid conditions.

    3.Stem Rot: Dark brown to black lesions can develop on stems, weakening and eventually killing them.

    4.Tuber Rot: Tubers show dark, firm, sunken areas that may develop into a brown, granular rot internally.


    ### Prevention:

    1. Resistant Varieties: Plant potato varieties that are resistant or tolerant to late blight.


    2. Seed Treatment: Use certified, disease-free seed potatoes to prevent initial infection.


    3. Crop Rotation: Practice crop rotation with non-host crops to reduce pathogen build-up in the soil.


    4. Proper Spacing: Space plants adequately to allow good air circulation and reduce leaf moisture.


    5. Field Hygiene: Remove and destroy infected plant debris and volunteer plants after harvest.


    6. Water Management: Avoid overhead watering and water early in the day so foliage dries quickly. Ensure proper drainage to prevent water accumulation.



    ### Cure:

    1. Fungicide Application:

    Chlorothalonil (e.g., Bravo)

    Metalaxyl or Mefenoxam for systemic action (e.g., Ridomil Gold)

    Cyazofamid and Fluopicolide for effective control



    2. Early and Regular Spraying: Apply fungicides preventively, especially during favorable conditions (cool, moist weather). Repeat applications as needed according to the product's guidelines.


    3. Copper-based Sprays: For organic management, copper-based fungicides can provide some protection.


    4. Integrated Disease Management (IDM): Combine chemical treatments with cultural practices for a more sustainable approach.



    ### Key Points:

    1.Rapid Action Needed: Late blight can spread quickly, so immediate action at the first sign of infection is crucial.

    2.Monitor Weather Conditions: Pay attention to weather forecasts; late blight thrives in cool, wet conditions, so preventive fungicide use is recommended during these periods.

    3.Field Sanitation: Properly dispose of infected plants and tubers to reduce sources of reinfection.

                    st.markdown("""

    Tomato Septoria Leaf Spot is a fungal disease caused by Septoria lycopersici. It is one of the most common diseases in tomatoes, particularly in humid and rainy conditions. The disease primarily affects the leaves, reducing photosynthesis and leading to premature leaf drop, which ultimately affects tomato yield and fruit quality.

    ### Symptoms:

    1. Small, Water-soaked Spots: Initially, small, circular, water-soaked spots (1/4 to 1/2 inch in diameter) appear on the lower leaves.

    2. Dark Brown or Gray Centers: The spots enlarge and become dark brown or grayish with a yellow halo around the edges.

    3. Leaf Yellowing: As the disease progresses, the tissue around the spots becomes yellow, leading to chlorosis (yellowing) of the leaves.

    4. Leaf Drop: In severe infections, the affected leaves may die and fall off, causing defoliation and reducing the plant's photosynthetic capacity.

    5. Spread to Upper Leaves: The disease spreads from lower leaves to upper leaves as the fungus continues to infect the plant.

    6. No Fruit Impact: While the disease primarily affects leaves, it does not usually cause direct damage to fruits unless the plant is severely weakened.


    ### Prevention:

    1. Resistant Varieties: Plant tomato varieties resistant to Septoria leaf spot if available in your region.


    2. Proper Spacing: Space plants adequately to improve airflow and reduce humidity around the foliage, which encourages fungal growth.


    3. Crop Rotation: Rotate tomatoes with non-host crops (such as beans or corn) to break the disease cycle and reduce inoculum buildup in the soil.


    4. Field Sanitation: Remove and destroy infected plant material, including fallen leaves, to reduce the source of infection.


    5. Avoid Overhead Irrigation: Use drip irrigation to avoid splashing water onto the foliage, which can spread the spores.


    6. Weed Control: Keep weeds under control, as they can harbor the fungal pathogen and serve as a reservoir for the disease.


    7. Mulching: Use mulch to reduce soil splash, which can spread the spores from the ground to the leaves.



    ### Cure:

    1. Fungicide Application:

    Fungicides such as Chlorothalonil, Mancozeb, and Copper-based fungicides are effective in controlling Septoria leaf spot.

    Azoxystrobin and Tebuconazole are also commonly used fungicides for control.

    Fungicides should be applied preventively or at the first sign of infection and repeated as recommended, especially during wet conditions.



    2. Pruning: Prune infected lower leaves to reduce the spread of the disease and improve air circulation in the plant canopy.


    3. Remove Infected Plants: Remove and destroy severely infected plants to prevent further spread of the disease.


    4. Biological Control: Use biological fungicides like Bacillus subtilis or Trichoderma spp. as part of an integrated pest management approach to suppress fungal growth.



    ### Key Points:

    1. Early Detection: Septoria leaf spot spreads rapidly under humid conditions, so early detection and prompt action are critical to minimizing damage.

    2. Cultural Practices: Cultural controls like proper spacing, crop rotation, and field sanitation are essential to preventing the spread of the disease.

    3. Fungicide Use: Regular fungicide application, especially during wet periods, is effective in controlling Septoria leaf spot.


    By implementing these preventive measures and using fungicides effectively, you can manage Tomato Septoria Leaf Spot and protect your crop from significant yield loss.""")

    Wheat Brown Rust, also known as Leaf Rust, is caused by the fungal pathogen Puccinia triticina. It is a significant disease of wheat that can lead to yield losses, particularly in susceptible varieties under favorable conditions for disease development. Warm temperatures and high humidity can accelerate the spread of brown rust.

    ### Symptoms:

    1.Rust Pustules: Small, circular to oval, orange-brown pustules appear on the upper leaf surface. These pustules can also appear on leaf sheaths and stems in severe cases.

    2.Scattered Distribution: The pustules are scattered and may cover large portions of the leaf as the disease progresses.

    3.Leaf Yellowing: Surrounding leaf tissue may turn yellow or brown as the infection progresses, leading to reduced photosynthesis.

    4.Premature Leaf Senescence: Severe infections can cause leaves to die early, reducing the plant's ability to produce grain effectively.

    5.Reduced Grain Quality: Infected plants may produce smaller, shriveled grains due to limited nutrient availability.


    ### Prevention:

    1. Resistant Varieties: Plant wheat varieties that are resistant or moderately resistant to brown rust.


    2. Crop Rotation: Practice crop rotation to break the disease cycle and reduce the pathogen load in the soil.
